Hi I'm Esther Muriu, a student in Kabarak University,Kenya studying Bachelor of science in Computer security and forensics.
I'm interested in  the forensic side of computers and AI and Machine learning in regards to security which is my major and I'm looking forward to becoming an expert in the field.
I'm currently learning advanced ethical hacking and  have a certification in cyber security from CISCO networking academy among a few others
I'm looking to collaborate on security based projects and incorporate my knowledge and ideas in creating a cybercrime free world despite the risks involved.

Hi I'm Esther Muriu, a student in Kabarak University,Kenya studying Bachelor of science in Computer security and forensics.
I' have currently ventured into  Ethical hacking and penetration testing which i'm learning and practicing curiously looking forward to becoming an expert in the field.
I'm looking to collaborate on security based projects and incorporate my knowledge and ideas in creating a cybercrime free world despite the risks involved.
